This natural peptide, isolated from that frog skin,  may contain a D amino acid residue, since it is not identical in chromatographic properties to the synthetic peptide (Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Nov 15;89(22):10960-3). Synthetic adenoregulin enhanced the binding of agonists to several G-protein-coupled receptors in rat brain membranes.

A helix-hinge-helix structural motif (helix 1: 1-8; helix 2: 11-31) was found in complex with SDS2003 micelles. The N-terminal segment residues 1-11 is critical for antibacterial activity (Lequin O et al. 2003 Biochemistry 42: 10311-23). Of note is that the structure in TFE is quite different.

A S-S bond led to a CYCLIC DODECAPEPTIDE, which is more active against gram- bacteria.  Only linearized versions of the peptides (Bac2A, obtained by converting the two Cys residues to Ala residues, plus C-terminal amidation) showed activtiy against Gram+ bacteria such as S. epidermidis and E. facaelis. The linearized or reduced forms appeared to be more effective in dissipating the membrane potential (Wu M and Hancock,RE 1999 JBC 274: 29-35). Like NaD1, Bac2A is unable to disrupt SUVs and interacts with intracellular targets yet to be identified (van der Weerden et al. 2010 JBC 285:37513-20). This peptide displayed synergistic effects with indolicidin (entry 150) against E. coli (Yan H & Hancock REW 2001 Antimicrob Agents Chemother 45: 1558-60). IDR-1018 has wound healing capability.

Also, Bac7(1ñ16) was an equally potent inhibitor as Bac7(1¬ñ35), consistent with the similar MICs observed for these two derivatives. Mechanism of action:  At ~MIC, the fragment binds to internal targets via stereospecific uptake (because all-D-enantiomer failed to be taken in and much less active); at higher concentrations, it works via non-specific membranolytic mechanism. Bac(1-16) is still active against E. coli and S. enterica but kinetically deficient compared to bac(1-35). Bac(5-35) is much less active, indicating the importance of the N-terminal segment (Biochim Biophys Acta 2006; 1760: 1732-1740). Crystal structures of Bac 7 fragments in complex with E. coli Dnak have been solved [PDB ID 4JWC (use the PDB link below) for Bac7(1-16) and 4JWD for Bac7(15-28 )]. However, Bac7(1-35) is likely to bind to the 70S ribosome and inhibit protein synthesis Mario Mardirossian et al, 2014online.  You can rotate, zoom, and view the structure of Bac7(1-35) in complex with the T. thermophilus 70S ribosome here in the PDB . By removing the first 4 critical residues, peptide Bac7(5-35) can only stabilize the initiation complex at a high concentration of 100 uM, providing a structural basis to the significance of the N-terminal segment (Seefeldt AC et al., 2016).

Disulfide bond is not required for the antimicrobial potency. Active against E. coli, S. enteritidis, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris, Y. enterocolitica, P. aeruginosa, C. jejuni, S. aureus, S. mutans, C. diphtheriae, L. monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Also active against E. coli ATCC 2592, M. luteus, and S. cerevisae (Ke T et al., 2012). Active against fungal biofilms (A. fumigatus, F. solani, and C. albicans) (Sengupta J et al., 2012). NMR structure: Residues 7-9 form beta1 and residues 17-19 form beta2 (in membrane). You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB . This contrasts with X-ray structure where residues 1-13 is helical. Thus, this peptide appears to be able to adopt a different conformation depending on environmental conditions. lactoferrin (Lf) peptide 2 is a derivative corresponding to residues 1-10 of LfcinB (Ueta E, Tanida T, Osaki T.2001 A novel bovine lactoferrin peptide, FKCRRWQWRM, suppresses Candida cell growth and activates neutrophils. J Pept Res 2001 Mar;57(3):240-9).  LfcinB6 (sequence: RRWQWR) corresponds to residues 4-9 of the peptide. Structure of LfcinB6 was determined in SDS micelles (Vogel HJ et al 2002 Biochem Cell Biol 80:49-63). Free LfcinB6 did not kill T-leukemia or breast cancer cells, but LfcinB6 was strongly cytotoxic when delivered to the cytosolic compartment by fusogenic liposomes (Richardson A 2009 Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2009 Aug 21). In vivo efficacy:Animal model:mouse: Injection of a 9-mer derivative, LTX-302, led to tumor necrosis, infiltration of inflammation, and complete regression in the majority of mice (Berge G et al., 2010 Cancer Immunol Immunother 59: 1285-94).  Appending hepta-arginine sequence via a glycine-glycine linker generates a more selective peptide MPLfcinB6 against  human T-leukemia and B-lymphoma cells by damaging cell membranes (Hilchie AL et al., 2013). Lactoferrin shows synergistic effects with lysostaphin or nisin.

Disulfide-bridge formation is indispensable for antimicrobial activity and is closely related to the activity specificity towards bacteria (Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2008 May 2;369(2):609-15). The S-S bond is also important for salt tolerance and for pore formation in membranes. C-terminal amidation had little effect. However, P. aeruginosa is 8-fold more sentive to the C-terminally amidated form. Antimicrobial activity decreases with the removel of more and more N-terminal residues (3 to 9). An all-D-enantiomer is almost inactive against Gram- bacteria but is fully active against fungi and some Gram+ bacteria, suggesting microbe-dependent mechanisms of action. Thanatin is not hemolytic. A hairpin-like structure was found in solution (Mandard et al 1998 Eur J Biochem 256: 404). You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB. A T15S mutant (S-thanatin) binds LPS. Trangenic plants: the thanatin transformant acquired a sufficient level of resistance to the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, presumably due to the repressive activity of thanatin to its initial stage of infection (Imamura T et al. 2010 Transgenic Res. 19:415-24).

In the synthetic peptide used for activity assays, the last Gly residue was converted to NH2 (more precisely, SMAP-28).  Removal of the C-terminal residues 18-28 or changing residues 22,25,and 26 to K disrupted hemolytic activity of the peptide (Shin et al 2001 BBRC 285: 1046). In TFE, residues 8-17 are helical, residues 18-19 serves as a hinge, and residues 20-28 are ordered (Tack BF et al. 2002 Eur J Biochem 269: 1181).  (MOA) Recently, it is proposed that SMAP-29 and hRNase 7 bind to an outer membrane protein I (OprI) of Gram-negative bacterium P. aeruginosa (Lin YM et al., 2010 J Biol Chem 285:8985). For another peptide working in a similar way, see the APD entry 431. Structure: You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB. Immobilization: The peptide has been immobilized to superparamagnetic beads and glass with antimicorbial activity (Soares et al., 2015). Ovispirin-1 (KNLRRIIRKIIHIIKKYG) was designed based on SMAP-29. Design: Ovispirin-1 (OV-1) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide similar to SMAP-29. OV-2 and OV-3 are shortened or mutated versions of OV-1 (Saiman L et al 2001 Antimicrob Agent Chemother. 45: 2838-44).  However, novispirin, obtained by changing residue I10 of OV-1 to G10, can kill bacteria rapidly but is relatively nontoxic to human cells (Sawai MV et al 2002 Protein Engineering 15: 225-232). Novicidin (seq: KNLRRIIRKGIHIIKKYF) is another derivative of OV-1.

Native pyrrhocoricin is largely disordered in solution with a subpopulation of ordered turns over residues 2-5, 4-7, and 16-19 based on NMR studies. The N-terminal region, residues 2-10, is important for activity, while the C-terminal half of the peptide is important for cell entrance. For the structure of the active region residues 1-10 in complex with the E. coli heat shock protein DnaK, see the PDB link. MOA:The peptide appears to target DnaK within bacteria via the N-terminal active region. All-D form is inactive, so not targeting bacterial membranes for killing. However, this peptide may acutally inhibit translationa process in the cell-free E. coli protein synthesis system (Taniguchi M et al., 2016).  The macrocyclic derivative incorporates a nine amino acid linker joining the N- and C-termini, which does not adversely affect the antimicrobial potency but leads to a broader spectrum of activity (Eur J Biochem 2002; 269: 4226-4237).

Subsequent analysis showed that S7 may also be glycosylated. Turn elements occur near residues 4-7, 10-13, 17, and 18. At modorate concentrations, this peptide, as well as pyrrhocoricin (AP170), is also active against a few  bacteria such as B. megaterium (44% homology to E. coli DnaK D-E helix) and M. luteus, E. coli D31 (MIC 0.5-1.0 uM) (Hoffmann R et al. 1999 Biochim Biophys Acta 1426:459-67). You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure of Cterminal fragment in complex with E. coli DnaKhere in the PDB. Mechanism of Action (MOA): It binds to an internal protein target DnaK (Eur J Biochem 2002; 269: 4226-4237). Note that all D-drosocin is inactive (so a non-membrane target) and the L form kills bacteria in hours not in minutes. Recently, it is demonstrated that this apidaecin-type peptide and its analog Dros (sequence: GKPRPYSPRPTSHPRPIRV) blocks the assembly of the large (50S) subunit of the ribosome, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis (Krizsan A et al., 2015). Substituting Pro at positions 3,5,10, and 14 with a hydroxylated Pro residues improved non-glycosylated drosocin activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Modification of Pro at positions 3 and 5 increased peptide stability in mouse serum.  The new peptides are not toxic to human cells tested at least 600 ug/ml.

HNP-1 is also active against Leishmania major promastigotes and amastigotesDabirian S et al., 2013. It can also promote wound healing. Enzyme inhibitor: it inhibits protein kinase C (Charp et al., 1988). HNP1 can also neutralize anthrax lethal toxin and other toxins (Kim C et al., 2005; Kim C et al., 2006). Structure: The 3 disulfide bonds are between residues 2-30, 4-19, and 9-29. Compared to HNP-2, HNP-1 contains one additional residue (Ala) at the N-terminus. It contains a long stretch of a double-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet in a hairpin conformation that contains a beta-bulge, a short region of triple-stranded beta-sheet, and several tight turns. You can rotate, zoom, and view the tetrameric crystal structure here in the PDB. There are multiple structures for HNP1 mutants or derivatives in the PDB.  MOA1: the L- and D-forms of HNP-1 (crystal structures are true mirror images) are equally active against E. coli, indicating membrane targeting. However, they displayed different activity against S. aureus. Subsequently, it was found that HNP-1 binds to cell wall precursor lipid II (dee Leeuw et al. 2010 FEBS Lett 584: 1543). MOA2: Although it is a lectin and binds to gp120 and CD4, HNP-1 was found to show inhibitory effects after HIV-1 entry (Wang et al. 2004 J Immunol 173: 515). MOA3: it inhibits non-enveloped BK virus infection by aggregating virions and blocking binding to host cells (JBC 2008; 283: 31125-31132). These examples indicate that the mechanisms of action of AMPs could depend on the type of organisms.  PTM: Arginine can be ADP-ribosylated and HNP1 became less antimicrobial and cytotoxic, thereby regulating peptide properties in vivo (Paone et al., 2002).

You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB.  Structure bound to LPS is here. Structure-activity relationship study improved peptide therapeutic index and reveals the importane of the beta-strands for stability (Edwards et al. 2017). MOA: it acts on bacterial membranes by forming a pore. Tac appears to influence the pathway underlying unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis related to membrane function (Liu et al., 2018). It inhibits HSV-1, HSV-2 (Yasin et al., 2000), an enveloped DNA virus of Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) and a non-enveloped RNA virus of viral nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) (Xie H et al., 2016). MOA: Its anti-HIV activity may be due to the inhibition of virual adsorption to cells (Morimoto et al 1991 Chemotherapy 37:206-11). Transgenic plants: expression of this peptide in patato improves resistance to pathogens (Montesinos E 2007 FEMS Microbiol Lett 270, 1-11).

Active against multiple species, including MRSA. It showed synergistic effect with LL-37 in killing S. aureus (Abou Aliwa et al., 2014). In addition to antibacterial effects, hBD-2 and hBD-3 induce chemotaxis via interactions with CCR2 or CCR6 expressing cells (Rohr J et al. 2010 J Immunol 184:6688-94). It contains three disulfide bonds and  a short helical segment preceding a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. These bridges are needed for chemotactic but not antibacterial activity.  It is a dimer in solution, which may be responsible for high antibacterial activity. Cf. HBD1 and HBD2 are monomers in solution (Schibli DJ et al. 2002 J Biol Chem 277: 8279).

Also Active against C. albicans, P. pastoris,  C. krusei, A. flavus, and F. solani. Also active against F. graminearum (see ref for AP2428). This peptide is unable to permeabilize liposomes (vesicles). Activity of Rs-AFP1 to Rs-AFP3 reduced in the presence of metal ions. The activity is related to the level of sphingolipid glucosylceramides (GlcCer) in the fungal membranes (Ravares PM 2008 Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 52: 4522-4525) since alteration of the structure of GlcCer or deletion of GlcCer led to poor activity. The Y38G mutant is not active against fungi, but retains the ability to interact with GlcCer, indicating binding to fungal membranes is necessary but not sufficient to kill fungi (De Samblanx GW et al 1997 J Biol Chem 272: 1171-1179). Recently, Aerts et al (2007 J Mol Microbiol Biotechnol 13: 243-7) showed that interaction of RsAFP2 with fungal GlcCer triggers a signal transduction pathway, leading to the production of  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and fungal death. These data support the two-step model for the mode of action (MOA) of RsAFP2. Transgenic plants: expression of this peptide in tobacco/tomato  improves resistance to pathogens (Montesinos E 2007 FEMS Microbiol Lett 270, 1-11).

A proline connects helix 1 (residues 5-10) and  helix 2 (residues 12-21). MOA: It kills bacteria without lysing the cell. Instead, this peptide translocates aross bacterial membranes effectively.  This is a typical peptide example that does not target bacterial membranes but internal targets such as nucleic acids. It has a strong affinity for DNA and RNA in vitro (Park et al 1998.

The relationship of human LL-37 with cancer is complex (Reviewed by Wu et al. 2010). While LL-37 could promote cancer metastasis in certain cases, its fragment (FK-16) have been documented to have anti-cancer effects (Li et al., 2006). 
Discovery: molecular formula of LL-37: C205H341N59O53; Mol. Wt. 4493.312; molar extinction coefficient = 0. Discovered in 1995 by three labs (see the ref;  Cowland JB et al. 1995;  Larrick JW et al. 1995). The precursor protein is human cationic antimicrobial protein-18 kDa (hCAP-18).  The mature peptide released by proteinase 3 is referred to as LL-37 (Gudmundsson GH et al., 1996), which is two residues shorter than the predicted form FALL-39 (old). Activity: Active against bacteria (E. coli. B. thailandensis, A. baunmannii, H. pylori, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, P. gingivalis, Y. pestis, B. anthracis, E. faecalis, S. aureus, S. mutans, M. tuberculosis (anti-TB), M. smegmatis, M. bovis, L. casei, L. monocytogenes, M. luteus, P. acnes, T. denticola, T. palidum, Y. pestis, A. xylosoxidans, B. suis, F. novicida, F. nucleatum, L. interrogans, Group A streptococcus, Group B streptococcus), fungi (C. albicans), viruses (HIV-1; Herpes Simplex Virus , HSV-1; respiratory syncytial virus, RSV; influenza virus; human adenovirus, HAdV; dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2)), Zika virus; the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) (Brice et al., 2018); parasites (e.g., E. histolytica), cancer cells. It inhibits F. novicida biofilms in vitro even at 0.24 ug/ml based on CV staining (Amer LS et al., 2010) (EC50 50 nM). It inhibits biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa below MIC (0.05 ug/ml) (Overhage J et al., 2008;Dean SN et al., 2011). It can also kill sperms, a possible spermicidal agent for developing a potential vaginal contraceptive  (Srakaew N et al., 2014). It shows synergistic effect with defensins or lysozyme.  
Structure: At an acidic condition, LL-37 is disordered, but becomes tetramer (involving residues 2-36) at elevated pH (~7) (Li et al., 2007). This tetramer is maintained in zwitterionic membranes but dissociated in anionic bacterial membranes (Oren et al. 1999 Biochem J 341:501-513). Upon association with bacterial outer membrane component LPS or inner membrane component PG, LL-37 adopts a long helix covering residues 2-31 with a disordered C-terminal tail. The membrane-bound high-resolution structure of LL-37 is determined by 3D NMR in the presence of SDS or D8PG using 13C,15N-labeled sample (Wang G, 2008). You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB. 
Sunlight and vitamin D are good: The expression of LL-37 is transcriptionally regulated by vitamin D (Karlsson J et al. 2008), sunlight, and other factors. The administration of vitamin D (25D3) as supplement (leading to cathelicidin expression in epithelial cells) may prevent unitary tract infection (UTI) (Hertting, O et al. 2010). Other AMP inducing factors are listed here.
Beyond antimicrobials: In addition to antimicrobial and anti-septic effects, LL-37 also possesses multiple other functions such as chemotaxis (e.g. to monocytes; T cells; peripheral blood neutrophils; eosinophils) via formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) (Yang D et al., 2000), mast cells via MrgX2 (Subramanian et al., 2011), activates CXCR2 receptor of neutrophils, purinergic receptor P2X7 in fibroblasts, and insulin growth factor receptor in epithelial cells, promotes wound healing, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and  immune modulation. LL-37 can also associate with human apolipoprotein A-I, F-actin and DNA and becomes inactive (reviewed by Wang, G 2007). The binding of LL-37 to LPS modulates the signal transduction via the TLR4 pathway, while its binding to bacterial DNA works via the TLR9 pathway.   
Post-translational modification: Arginines of LL-37 can get citrullinated (KilsgÂrd et al., 2012), weakening its ability in preventing endotoxin-induced sepsis (Koziel J et al., 2014). Also, up to four out of the five arginines of LL-37 can be ADP-ribosylated, thereby regulating peptide properties in vivo (Picchianti et al., 2015). LL-37 may also be carbamylated (Koro et al., 2016). LL-37 can be cleaved by multiple proteases such as cathepsins S and K. However, it inhibits cathepsin L (Andrault PM et al., 2015). 
Surface immobilization: LL-37 has also been covalently immobilized 2006 Gabriel M et al.  to the titanium surface. So are KR-12 (the minimal antimicrobial peptide), IG-25 that corresponds to residues 13-37 of LL-37, and the major antimicrobial region FK-16 (GF-17 minus N-terminus G) (Mishra and Wang, 2017).  
The LL-37 story will surely continue to evolve. Found in multiple species. Also see ALL-38.

You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB .  The authors found that truncation of the C-terminal hydrophobic tail (BMAP27(1-18)) improved peptide selectivity but had little effect on antimicrobial activity.  In addition, BMAP-18 ( i.e. N-terminal 18-residues of BMAP-27) is HIV-active. Further deletion of three C-terminal residues from BMAP-18 led to a peptide (BMAP-15) that is inactive to HIV-1 (Wang, G., et al. 2008. Antimicrobial Agents & Chemotherapy 52: 3438-3440).

BMAP-28 has broad antimicrobial activities and confers protection in an animal model:mouse of bacterial infection or sepsis (Giacometti A et al. 2004 Crit Care Med 32, 2485-90). Furthermore, BMAP-28 and its isomers demonstrated anti-leishmanial activities against intracellular L. major amastigotes within a macrophage infection model. Interestingly, the D-amino acid form is more active against parasites than either BMAP-28 (the L form) or the sequence reversed form (Lynn MA et al 2011 PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 5(5):e1141). Trucation of the C-terminal tail  reduced hemolysis.  Of note, a modified peptide (mBMAP-28) was also synthesized by replacing the C-terminal hydrophobic tail (residues 20-28) with a more hydrophilic sequence QATPATRQ also reduced peptide cell selectivity. BMAP-28 is also antiviral (e.g., simplex virus type 1, HSV-1) (Benincasa et al., 2003).

The first theta-defensin reported. It is a two gene ligation product. RTD-1 is most abundant (~50% of the RTD content; the ratio of RTD1, -2, and 3 are 29:1:2). Total RTD content varied by 3 fold between animals (see ref for AP1074). It contains three disulfide bonds: 3,16; 5,14; 7,12. The molecule self associates in water in a concentration-depedent manner.  Initially thought flexible (PDB ID: 1HVZ), the refined 3D structure revealed a rigid beta-hairpin structure (PDB ID: 2LYF; Conibear AC et al., 2012).  You can rotate, zoom, and view the refined 3D structure here in the PDB. Antibacterial activity of this circular molecule is salt-insensitive compared to non-circular alpha-defensins. The antibacterial activity of synthetic and isolated forms is indistinguishable. Acyclic RTD peptides are substantially less active against E. coli and S. aureus. MOA1: Theta-defensins are internalized rapidly by target bacterial cells. Theta-defensins are particularly important for antifungal activity of the granule extracts as alpha-defensins are poorly active (Tongaonkar P et al 2011 J Leuko Biol in press). It is also active against HIV-1. MOA2: it binds to gp120 and CD4, thereby inhibiting HIV entry (Wang W J Immunol 2004; 173:515-520).

Activity:While the reduced form is active against both Gram+ and Gram- bacteria, the oxidized form is only active against Gram- bacteria with little effect on cell envelope (Raschig J et al., 2017). hBD-1 is one of the most prominent peptides of its class but despite ubiquitous expression by all human epithelia, comparison with other defensins suggested only minor antibiotic killing activity. Interestingly, it inhibits the growth of clinical S. aureus strains but NOT lab strains. It was observed that hBD-1 from human platelets can cluster bacteria and signals NETs formation (Kraemer BF et al. 2011 PLoS Pathog Nov 7). This AMP is a salt-sensitive antibiotic in lung that is inactivated in cystic fibrosis (Cell. 1997 Feb 21;88(4):553-60). It is VERY interesting that after reduction of disulphide-bridges, hBD-1 becomes a potent AMP against the opportunistic pathogenic fungus C. albicans and against anaerobic, Gram-positive commensals of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species. It seems to work using a different mechanism from hBD-3 (mainly on membranes). For a full story, please refer to Schroeder BO et al Reduction of disulphide bonds unmasks potent antimicrobial activity of human beta-defensin 1 Nature. 2011 Jan 20;469(7330):419-23 (APD recommended reading). Apoptosis. This AMP shows synergistic effect with LL-37 or lysozyme against S. aureus and E. coli (Chen X et al 2005 J Dermatol Sci 40: 123-32). Structure nmr+x: it contains one helix and three beta-strands linked by three disulfide bonds (NMR: Bauer F et al. 2001 Protein Sci 10:2470, use the PDB link; X-ray: Hoover DM et al 2001 J Biol Chem 276:39021-6; PDB: 1IJV). You can rotate, zoom, and view the NMR structure here in the PDB . You can view the crystal structure here.  Chemotactic: chemotactic effects of hBD-1 is achieved via the CCR6 receptor  expressed on
immature dendritic cells and CD45RO+ and CD4+ T cells (Pazgier M et al., 2007). The CCR6-mediated chemotaxis surface is defined by the N-terminal alpha-helical region (Asp(1)... Ser(8)) and a few topologically adjacent residues (Lys(22), Arg(29), and Lys(33)). Channel inhibitor: HBD1 was found to selectively inhibit human and mouse Kv1.3 channels with IC50 values of 11.8 ± 3.1 uM and 13.2 ¬± 4.0 uM, respectively (Feng J et al., 2016). Relationship with human diseases High hBD-1 is an accurate predictor of short-term mortality in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) (Mani et al., 2018). In colonic epithelial cells, hBD-1 is supressed by the EGFR-ERK-MYC axis (Bonamy et al., 2018).

Active against E. coli BM21 (MIC 0.08-5 ug/ml), E. coli AB1133 (MIC 0.02-2.5 ug/ml), E. coli RYC816 (MIC 0.04-2.5 ug/ml), E. coli AY29 (0.04 in LB), and S. newport (MIC 0.01 ug/ml). MccJ25 (formerly Mcc25) is the single representative of the immunity group J.  Four plasmid genes (plasmid-encoded) are required for MccJ25 biosyntheis: mcjA encodes the precursor protein, mcjB and mcjC encode two processing enzymes to generate mature peptide, and mcjD encodes the immunity protein (McjD), a member of the ABC transporter family. Immunity is achieved by active efflux of the processed peptide.  Bacterial mutants resistant to MccJ25 can taken in the peptide via the outer membrane protein FhuA (the iron siderophore receptor) and inner membrane proteins TonB, ExbD, ExbB and SbmA. (MOA): It works by dual mechanism, interaction with RNA polymerase or membrane respiratory enzyme chain(Bellomio et al., 2007). 
Old Structure: Originally proposed as a head-to-tail cyclic peptide (Blond 1999). Current structure (2003): MccJ25 has an unusual lariat-protoknot (""threaded lasso"") structure consisting of an eight aa residue ring formed between the backbone NH of residue Gly1 and the side chain CO of residue Glu8 (XXCsb) (Wilson et al, 2003; Rosenqren et al., 2003). You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB. The 13-residue tail loops back and pass through the ring and locked via aromatic rings of residues F19 and Y20 (see the structure in PDB). Systematic structure-activity analysis of MccJ25 revealed that only three in the ring and one in the tail are important for this peptide production. Furthermore, two residues in the ring and four in the threaded segment of the tail are essential for transcription inhibition (JBC 2008; 37: 25589-25595). It showed prolong effect in an animal model:mouse infection model  (Lopez et al., 2007). 
This lasso fold is used as a stable peptide scaffold for grafting therapeutic peptides to enhance peptide stability (Hegemann et al., 2014).

It accumulates in nucleus and interacts with cell cycle control protein cyclin F as the target (Lobo et al., 2007).  By screening C. albicans mutant libraries we identified that the High-Osmolarity Glycerol (HOG) pathway has a unique role in protection against NaD1 that induces reactive oxygen species that damage cells. Thus, inhibition of the HOG pathway holds promise as a broad strategy for increasing efficacy of antimicrobial peptides against C. albicans (Hayes BM, et al. 2013).

The level of hBD-2 in human milk is in the range of 2.6-16.3 ug/ml in Latin American women (Baricelli J et al., 2014).  Active against and killed E. coli, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and C. albicans but show bacteriostatic effect on S. aureus.  Activity is salt-sensitive. It also shows synergistic effect with LL-37 in controling group B Streptococcus, an important neonatal pathogen (Dorschner RA et al., 2003). Both hBD-2 and hBD-3 inhibit R5 and X4 types of HIV-1 infection in a dose-dependent manner (Sun et al. 2005 J Virol 79: 14318-29). MOA: Its anti-HIV-1 effect may be due to a direct inactivation of cell-free virions and inhibition viral replication after cDNA formation (Weinberg et al 2006 Adv Dent Res 19: 42-8). Dietary histone deacetylase inhibitor sulforaphane and butyrate induces HBD-2 expression in intestinal epithelial cells (Immunology 2008; 125: 241-51). In addition, hBD-2 and hBD-3 induce chemotaxis via interactions with CCR2 (Rohrl J et al., 2010) or CCR6 expressing cells (Yang et al., 1999). IL-17A and IL-17F are most effective inducer of hBD-2 in human airway epithelial cells (Archer NK et al., 2016). The 3 disulfide bonds are between residues 8-37, 15-30, and 20-38.  The structure (one N-terminal helix and 3 beta strands) was found to be monomer in solution (Sawai MW et al 2001 Biochemistry 40:3810; PDB ID: 1E4Q) but a dimer in the crystal (Hoover DM et al 2000 J Biol Chem 275:32911; use the PDB link below (nmr+x). There are other crystal structures solved in a differnt crystal or for mutants, as well as NMR structure solved by Sawai et al. (2001), see 1FQQ. Note that there are multiple mutant structures in the PDB. You can rotate, zoom, and view the dimeric crystal structure 1FD3 here in the PDB. Such a fold can be imporant for inhibiting the Kv1.3 potassium channel (channel inhibitor). Also, its antifungal structure in complex with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) has been determined (J‰rv√• M et al., 2018). Mutations in these sites ablate PIP2-mediated fungal growth inhibition by HBD-2. You can rotate, zoom, and view the complex crystal structure here. It also has wound healing effect (Otte JM et al., 2009). Transgenic plants: expression of this peptide in Arabidopsis thaliana reduced fungal infection (Plant Cell Rep. 2007 Aug;26(8):1391-8).

Which one corresponds to the native CATH-2 is not yet clear. The additional five residues appeared not to have a significant effect on antimicrobial activity (Dijk A et al 2009 Mol Immun. 46: 2465-2473).

Antibacterial activities of other synthetic peptides: the N-terminal 15 residues are most potent, peptide residues 1-21 and peptide residues 12-26 are weakest; substitution of P by G only reduced activity slightly, but a change of Pro by Leu greatly reduced antibacterial activity. The potent peptides can kill bacteria rapidly in 5-10 minutes. Of interest, peptides corresponding to residues 1-15 or residues 12-26 showed poor hemolytic activity.

In particular, the peptidoglycan of the mutants featured a higher content of muropeptides with tripeptide side chains than the wild-type strain, linking for the first time peptidoglycan remodelling to bacteriocin resistance. Moreover, L. lactis lacking a functional D,D-carboxypeptidase DacA (i.e., with a high content of pentapeptide side chain muropeptides) was shown to be more susceptible to Lcn972 (Roces et al., 2012).

You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB . The Ser9 site splits the hydrophobic surface of the amphipathic helix into two domains, which explains its poor antimicrobial activity (active against only susceptible bacterial strains). Based on the 3D structure, however, a mutation of Ser9 with either Ala or Val modulates the activities of LL-23. The Ser9Val mutant can better penetrate into membranes, leading to improved antibacterial activity.

		Go to PDB","anti-Gram-,","","This dimeric peptide was designed to target both bacterial membranes and intracellular heat-shock protein (visit the PDB link). The N-terminus of the peptide contains 1-amino-cyclohexane carboxylic acid (Chex1). This chain then formed a dimer by covalently linking to 2,4-diamino-butyric acid. It is of outstanding interest that A3-apo (residues 1-20) can bind in both the forward and reversed mode.  You can rotate, zoom, and view the ball and stick structure here in the PDB. AMP stability: the peptide showed remarkable stability in 25% mouse serum (half-life 100 min) (Noto PB et al 2008 Protein Sci 17: 1249-55). Animal model:mouse: Of outstanding interest is that this peptide displayed systemic therapeutic effects in different mice models against E. coli, A. baumannii via mainly intramuscular administration, although intravenous treatment also showed some effect (see the ref). It is proposed that the dimer is decomposed in vivo into the active metabolite. Note that the monomer, Chex-Arg20, showed no membrane activity, while multimerization of chex-arg20 led to membrane-disruptive activity (Li W et al., 2015).

The major antimicrobial region of human cathelicidin LL-37 discovered by the NMR method. Active against E. coli ATCC 25922, K. pneumonia ATCC 13883, P. aeruginosa PAO1, and S. aureus USA300 (MIC 3.1-6.2 uM).  In complex with membrane-mimetic micelles, GF-17 has a helical structure and interfacial R23 and K25 were found to be essential for antibacterial activity as well as membrane penetration, primarily against G- bacteria (Wang G et al. 2012). You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB. FK-16 was demonstrated to have anticancer activity in vitro in 2006 (see the ref) and in vivo in 2013 against colon cancer cells (Ren SX et al. 2013). FK-16 shows antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities against a variety of pathogens after covalently immobilized to the titanium surface (Mishra and Wang, 2017). FK-13 is the core antimicrobial peptide corresponding to residues 17-29 (sequence: FKRIVQRIKDFLR) of LL-37.  Reversal of the sequence of FK-13 led to an LL-37-derived aurein 1.2 analog (LLAA, i.e retro-FK13; sequence RLFDKIRQVIRKF), which remained active against E. coli (Li X et al. 2006 Biochim Biophys Acta 1758: 1203-1214). While FK-13 is also active against HIV-1, retro-FK13 is not (Wang G et al. 2008 Antimicrob Agents Chemother 52: 3438-3440). However, anti-HIV GI-20, corresponding to residues 13-32 of LL-37 with the positions of I13 and G14 swapped, showed the highest therapeutic index.  17BIPHE2 was designed based on the 3D structure of GF17d3 (Wang et al., 2014). 17BIPHE2 is active against the ESKAPE pathogens (MIC 3.1-6.2 uM).

Cellular location: accumulated in vacuole and processed likely by asparaginyl endoproteinase (Conlan BF et al. 2011 Am J Bot 98:2018-26). Structure: there are other PDB entries: 1JJZ, 1NB1, and 1ZNU. You can rotate, zoom, and view the 4TTM structure here in the PDB . Antibacterial activity was salt dependent and the peptide was most active against S. aureus (0.26 uM). The overall fold is important for anti-HIV activity, since the acyclic permutant is inactive. Kalata B1 also has uterotonic and insecticidal activity (natural pesticide). (MOA) An all D-analog is also active, supporting membrane targeting (Sando L. et al. 2011 Chembiochem 12: 2456-62). NMR studies of the ternary complex identified amino acid residues in loop 5 (W23, P24, and V25) and loop 6 (L2, P3, and V4) are important for membrane binding (Shenkarrev ZO et al. 2006 FEBS J 273:2658-72). It binds to phosphatidylethanolamine and leads to pore formation (41-70 A) in lipid bilayers (Huang et al 2009 JBC 284: 20699-20707). Oligomerization on the membrane surface could be important for this process. Note that oxidized forms of this peptide have also been reported. Trp can be oxidized to oxindolylalanine I (oia) or N-formylkynurenine (nfk). The effect of such oxidation on activity is unknown (Plan MR et al 2007 Chembiochem 8:1001-11). It also inhibits the human prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) (Hellinger R et al., 2015).

          Ref","anti-Gram+ & Gram-, antifungal,  Mammalian cells,","","Initially reported as a separate peptide called pilosulin 2 (see the ref). In 2017, a new form was reported (Dekan et al., 2017). This chain (AP890)  can form a heterodimer with pilosulin 3 (AP891). Because of this reason, AP891 is kept in the database as well. AP890 and AP891 forms an antiparallel dimer connected by two disulfide bonds: C16 of AP890 with C17 of AP891; C23 of AP890 and C10 of AP891. NMR determination revealed two helical peptides connected by two intermolecular S-S bonds. Active against E. coli ATCC 25922, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, K. pneumoniae ATCC BAA-2146, A. baumannii ATCC 19606 (MIC 0.025 uM), P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, P. aeruginosa FADDI-PA70, S. aureus ATCC 43300, S. aureus NRS 1, S. aureus NRS 17, S. aureus NARSA-VRS1 (MIC 3.2-6.4), S. aureus NARSA-VRS10, and S. pneumoniae ATCC 700677(MIC mostly  0.1-0.8 uM). Also toxic to human kidney cells (LC50=0.57 uM) and hemolytic ability (HC50=2.2 uM). So, this is a true poison-type AMP. Peptide connection mode was corrected in 5/2017.

Predicted to be helical based on the known structure of human LL-37. OH-CATH30 is obtained by removing the N-terminal 4 residues. OH-CM6 is obtained by further shortening OH-CATH30 by deleting the C-terminal 10 residues followed by mutations. These derivatives are active against indicator and resistant bacterial strains (MIC in the range of 1.5-25 ug/ml). Activity is reduced in the presence of serum. However, the D-form is stable for at least 12 h. These peptides appear to work on membranes as indicated by rapid killing in 60 min (2XMIC) and dye leakage. Both OH-CATH30 and OH-CM6 displayed in vivo efficacy in reducing drug-resistant E. coli burdens in the neutropenic thigh infection animal model:mouse or murine bacteremia model. It also showed protective effects on E. coli induced rabbit urinary tract infection models (animal model:rabbit)( Zhang et al., 2013). The D-form of these peptides is also active in vivo although with higher cytotoxicity ( Li SA et al. 2010). In addition, topical application of OH-CATH30 is efficacious against drug-resistant P. aeruginosa keratitis ( Li SA et al., 2014).

R40 is pivotal for NAD1:PIP2 complex formation and oligomerization is needed for membrane permeation.","Active against F. oxysporum, B. cinerea, A. niger, Cryptococcus species, as well as the yeasts S. cerevisiae and C. albicans. NaD1 itself forms a dimer  in the crystal (Lay et al., 2012). You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB.  In 2014, the crystal structure of a NaD1:PIP2 or PI(4,5)P2 complex was also solved. Remarkably, seven dimers of NaD1 (14 momecules) oligomerize into an arch configuration to cooperatively bind the anionic headgroups of 14 phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) molecules  (Poon IKh et al., 2014).  Like RsAFP2, NaD1 is unable to disrupt lipid vesicles. The antifungal activity involves specific interaction with the fungal cell wall (surface protein) followed by membrane permeation and entry of the cell to affect internal targets (van der Weerden et al. 2008 J Biol Chem 283:14445-14452; van der Weerden et al 2010 JBC 285:37513-37520). It is proposed that the peptide enters fungal cytoplasm via he energy-dependent process of endocytosis (Hayes et al., 2018). Evidence for carpet model (J¸æçÜîºrv√• M et al., 2018). NaD1 induces tumor cell death via a non-apoptotic, membranolytic process (Baxter AA et al., 2017).

		Go to PDB","anti-Gram+ & Gram-, antifungal,  Surface immobilized AMPs,","","The shortest active peptide of the cecropin A and melittin hybrid. CM15 is a linear, synthetic hybrid AMP composed of residues 1-8 of cecropin A (AP00139) and residues 3-9 of the bee venom peptide mellitin (entry AP00146). The peptide forms pore on membranes.  CAMEL (seq: KWKLFKKIGAVLKVL) is also a hybrid peptide obtained by combining residues 1-7 of cecropin (CA) and residues 2-9 of melittin (M). CP-29 is also derived from cecropin A and residues 7-18 of melittin. The peptide was designed to have a more helical structure that targets the membranes of Gram-negative bacteria (Fridrich et al 1999 AAC 43:1542-1548). You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure here in the PDB. It has been surface immobilized 2016 onto gold nanoparticles at a high density of 110 ug/cm2 with a braod activity spectrum (Rai A et al., 2016).

It is a chemoattractant for various cells such as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and monocytes at 10 nM (Deng et al 2005 J Immunol 174:5243-8).

Unmodified form (u-Mcc492) has been found (JBC 279: 28232-28242, 2004) but is inactive. More amyloid forms with the increase in u-Mcc492 (Marcoleta A et al., 2013).  The attachment of a trimer of N-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-L-serine  to the C-terminal Ser of MccE492 via glycosidic linkage led to Fe3+ binding capability (i.e. siderophore peptide) and enhanced antibacterial activity. The polypeptide core of Microcin E492 stably associates with the mannose permease and interferes with mannose metabolism (commented by Erni; Res Microbiol. 2010 Oct;161(8):706-10). The peptide also exists as non-toxic aggregates (amyloid formation) Updated 11/6/10; 7/1/2011; 3/2014.","Isolation and characterization of microcin E492 from Klebsiella pneumoniae.","de Lorenzo V.1984","Arch Microbiol. 1984 Sep;139(1):72-5."

RC-101 (seq: GICRCICGKGICRCICGR) is obtained by changing R9 to K9 to facilitate chrorophore-labeling. RC-111 has the same amino acid sequence as RC-100 and is also cyclic, but its residues are placed in reverse order along the peptide's backbone. RC-111ox, an acyclic variant of RC-111 with a beta-hairpin structure, also inhibited HIV-1 infection, but did so less effectively than cyclic RC-111 (AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2007; 23:508-14). RC-112 is composed exclusively of D-amino acids, whereas retrocyclin-1 contains only L-amino acids. RC-112 is more active than retrocyclin-1 against HIV, probably owing to higher stability to proteases ( J Pept Res. 2004 Jun;63(6):469-76). MOA: It binds to gp120 and CD4, thereby inhibiting HIV entry (Wang W J Immunol 2004; 173:515-520).

E. coli TldD and TldE interact to form a heterodimeric metalloprotease. TldD/E cleaves the N-terminal leader sequence from the modified MccB17 precursor peptide, to yield mature antibiotic, while it has no effect on the unmodified peptide (Ghilarov D et al., 2017). Escherichia coli sbmA can recognize perhaps the thiazole rings to internalize the peptide which targets DNA gyrase. MOA: MccB17 is the first known DNA gyrase inhibitor of peptidic nature (Viz·n JL et al., 1991). Synthetic peptides without the N-terminal Glycine-rich domain are strongly stabilize the gyrase-DNA cleavage complex with icreased potency.

Killing of B. subtilis by either TC appeared to be very rapid. Because TCs were unable to dissipate the membrane potential of L. lactis, the mechanism of TC-mediated killing most probably does not involve pore formation.  TC-1 is obtained by truncating 2 residues from the C-terminus of NAP-2. The structure of NAP-2 was determined by both X-ray and NMR (NMR+x). The protein is a tetramer (see the PDB link below) in the crystal (Malkowski MG,et al., 1995). Since the functional form is a monomer, NMR was utilized to study the soultion structure and backbone dynamics of the monomeric form of the protein in the presence of a 2-chloroethanol -water solvent (Young H et al. 1999). While both ends of NAP-2 are disordered, the middle region contains a three-stranded beta-sheet followed by a well-defined helix. A comparative NMR relaxation analysis reveals a less mobile Asp70 at the C-terminus of NAP-2, probably due to electrostatic interactions with the helix portion. In constrast, the C-terminal tail of TC-1 remains disordered. Such dynamics difference between NAP-2 and TC-1 may explain in part the higher antimicrobial acitivity of TC-1 (Nguyen LT et al. 2011). Likewise, insertion of an acidic residue to the N-terminus of GF-17 also substantially reduced its antibacterial activity (Wang G et al., 2012 ). In both cases, one acidic amino acid decreased the membrane perturbation potential of the peptides (Wang G et al., 2005 JBC) and made them less effective to target the negative surface of bacteria.

For infection and wounding, the induction is dependent on a p38 MAP kinase cascade, but for osmotic stress, this pathway is not required. A pathway involving fatty acid synthesis and the evolutionary conserved wnk?1 and gck?3/Ste20/GCK?VI kinases modulates nlp?29 expression in the C. elegans epidermis, independently of p38 MAPK signaling.

It is actually a S-linked glyco-peptide (Oman TJ et al. 2011 Nat Chem Biol 7:78-80), i.e. a class IV bacteriocin according to the original classification. Sublancin does not react with iodoacetamide demonstrating it does not contain free thiols. However, after treatment with TCEP, four out of five cysteines became accessible for alkylation.  Cys-22 glycosylation (glucose attachment) is essential for antimicrobial activity. There is only one thioether ring between T19-C22 but two disulfide bonds (C7-C36 and C14-C29). Such bridges confer superior stability to this peptide (no degradation after storing in water at room temp for TWO years!) (see the ref). Active against S. aureus and B. subtilis. Its 3D structure has been determined by NMR (Garcia De Gonzalo CV, et al., 2014). The two helices (residues 6-16 and 26-35) are adjacent to each other and linked via a well-defined loop. MOA: NaCl lowered bacterial susceptibilities. It was found that large mechanosensitive channel MscL determines bacterial susceptibility to sublancin 168.

Microbisporicin A1 has five thioether rings: S3-C7, T8-C11, S13-C20, S18-C23, and S21-C24. Also, residues T2 and S5 are dehydrated.

Interestingly, microbisporicin A2 shares the same amino acid sequence with A1 with the only difference being that Pro14 is only monohydroxylated at position 4.  MOA: Microbisporicins A1 and A2 displayed similar antibacterial activity by selectively blocking peptidoglycan biosynthesis, leading to cytoplasmic accumulation of the UDP-linked precursor.  NAI-108 is a bromonated variant of NAI-107. It is obtained by inclusion of KBr in the production medium of either the Actinoallomurus or the Microbispora producer.

However, a change of P11 to R, removal of N19, and C-terminal amidation led to a potent (MIC 4-8 ug/ml) antibacterial peptide called oncocin (Knappe D et al 2010 J Med Chem 53: 5240-5247). Oncocin is particularly active against Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii).  The 3D structure for the complex between oncocin and a portion of the E. coli heat shock protein has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The AMP was found to bind to the beta-strand region of the protein (Knappe D et al. 2011 ChemBioChem 12:874). However, it was not clear how this binding kills bacteria. More recently, it is demonstrated that oncocins can also bind the 50S subunit of the 70S ribosome, thereby providing a more likely mechanism that inhibits protein synthesis (Krizsan A et al., 2015). You can rotate, zoom, and view the complex structure with ribosome here in the PDB. Onc112 bound to the 70S ribosome with residues 1-12 binding to the exit tunnel.

It also kills three oral microorganisms (grown planktonically): S. gordonii, F. nucleatum, and P. gingivalis (Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2007 May;51(5):1837-9). WLBU2 also reduced the bacterial burden of S. gordonii and F. nucleatum biofilms. The minimal DNA bundling concentrations of LL-37 and WLBU2 are similar to the concentrations necessary to ensure effective bacteria killing. CSA-13, a member of the ceragenin family, like natural LL37 or synthetic WLBU2 and HB71 peptides targets the bacterial wall through interactions with LPS and LTA. The ability of CSA-13 to maintain its bactericidal activity in the presence of negatively charged F-actin and DNA and the observed additive effect of CSA-13 with rhDNase I suggest that this synthetic antibiotic has potential advantages in treating chronic infection in CF airways (J Antimicrob Chemother. 2007 Sep;60(3):535-45).  Animal model:mouse: Intravenous injection of the peptide at 12 mg/Kg can protect mice from death due to i.p, infected P. aeruginosa. For the mice given peptide post-bacterial infection, in the 1 mg/kg group, nine of nine animals died because of Pseudomonas sepsis; in the 3 mg/kg group, only one of nine succumbed to infection and in the 4 mg/kg group, all mice were protected (P < 0.0001) by the peptide (Deslouches B et al., 2007).

The antimicrobial role of this peptide has also been demonstrated in a mouse model. Salmonella typhimurium bacterial infection of the brains of transgenic 5XFAD mice caused rapid seeding and accelerated beta-amyloid deposition, which closely colocalized with the invading bacteria. Thus, it is possible that beta-amyloid plays a protective role in innate immunity and infectious or sterile inflammatory stimuli may drive amyloidosis (Kumar et al., 2016).Updated 11/2014; 3/2018.","The Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid beta-protein is an antimicrobial peptide","Soscia SJ, Kirby JE, Washicosky KJ, Tucker SM, Ingelsson M, Hyman B, Burton MA, Goldstein LE, Duong S, Tanzi RE, Moir RD2010","PLoS One. 2010 Mar 3;5(3):e9505"

Although papiliocin displayed a broad antimicrobial spectrum, it is not hemolytic and especially active against Gram-negative bacteria. This cecropin-like membrane-active peptide may form a pore (2.3-3.3 nm) in the fungal membranes (J Microbiol Biotechnol. 2010 Aug;20(8):1185-8).  It could also induce yeast apoptosis (Hwang B et al 2011 Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 408: 89-93). The peptide also showed antiinfammatory activities. In DPC micelles, the peptide adopted a helix-hinge-helix conformation (H1:residues 3-21 and H2: 25-36).

MOA: the interferon-inducible, ELR(-) chemokine CXCL10 kills the Gram-positive pathogen B. anthracis through two independent mechanisms: (1) by interaction with the bacterial FtsE/X complex, which does not require the CXCL10 C-terminal alpha-helix, and (2) through membrane disruption by the C-terminal alpha-helix, which does not need the FtsE/X complex (Margulieux KR et al., 2016).

Importantly, this CD8+ T cells derived chemokine inhibits a broad spectrum of HIV isolates. MOA:HIV: this inhibition occurs at the early stage of infection and blocks viral attachment and subsequent entry by direct interaction with the gp120 envelope glycoprotein. Structure: You can rotate, zoom, and view the 3D structure of the all-beta dimerhere in the PDB. However, this metamorphic protein can adopt two conformations (classic and alternative) and only the alternative, all-beta conformation (dimer) is HIV-active, while the monomer (consisting of 3 strans and one helix) activates the receptor XCR1 for chemotactic effects. The all-beta dimer variant of XCL1 binds to proteoglycans (glycosaminoglycans, GAGs) (provided by Dr. Brian F. Volkman). Residues W55, K42, and R43 are essential for anti-HIV activity. In addition, R18, R35, and K46 are also important for HIV inhibition. Remarkably, most of these positively charged side chains are clustered on the active protein surface, but disociated in the classic chemokine fold, thereby providing a structural basis for HIV inhibition and anti-HIV drug design (Guzzo C et al. 2015). Protein engineering: Interestingly, introducing a disulfide bond between A36C and A49C mutants locks the chemokine conformation to the all-beta dimeric form (dubbed CC5), which is indeed a potent HIV inhibitor with high affinity to heparin (Fox JC et al., 2015).

Pln149a was active against one strain of S. aureus and four strains of Listeria genus at pH 5.5 and 7.4 and, like its natural variant, inhibited L. plantarum ATCC 8014.  It is helical in TFE and a reverse micelle (M¸ller DM et al., 2007). The amidated form also inhibited the growth of fungi such as S. cerevisiae.  Pln149a does not interact with either mono/polysaccharides or zwitterionic LUVs, but is strongly adsorbed to and incorporated into negatively charged surfaces, causing a conformational change in its secondary structure from random-coil to helix upon adsorption (Lopes JL et al., 2009).  Fatty acid conjugation of shorter peptides with low antimicrobial activity resulted in lipopeptides with improved activity against strains of S. aureus and L. monocytogenes. The length of the fatty acid determined the bacterial specificity, and the conjugation with n-octanoic acid yielded the most active analog (C8-CT) against S. aureus  (MIC: 1.0 uM) while the conjugation with n-dodecanoic acid (C12-CT) was optimal for L. monocytogenes (MIC: 2.0 uM)(Siano A et al., 2011).

In the natural form, there are multiple Dab (2,4-diaminobutanoic acid), which are represented here as lysines. The molecule is cyclic due to the formation of an amide bond between the amino group of Dab in position 4 and the carboxyl group of the C-terminus. Residue Leu6 is a D-amino acid and the N-terminus is attached by a fatty acid (fatty acid A=6-methyloctanoic acid; B=6-methylheptanoic acid). It preferentially binds to LPS of Gram-negative bacteria and disrupts membranes (Moser et al., 2014).  Because of such interesting properties, there is interest in developing polymyxin analogs.

The 3D structure consists of  four alpha-helices (residues 7-24, 32ñ36, 42¬ñ47 and 54¬ñ58) connected by three loop regions and stabilized by five disulfide bridges: Cys5-Cys42, Cys13-Cys45, Cys24-Cys31, Cys47-Cys55 and Cys51-Cys61. Inactive dimer forms at pH 8 via deprotonation of His50 and His59. A pH-dependent trigger generates the active monomer form. The oligomerization state of the amoebic protein to form a pore (~0.5 nm) is virtually independent of the protein-to-lipid ratio, it may be assumed that acanthaporin functions by a barrel-stave mechanism in membranes.

There are 4 D-amino acids and enduracididine (represented with an Arg here). Activity: Active against primarily Gram-positive bacteria, including S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), E. faecalis (anti-VRE), S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae,  B. anthracis, C. difficile, P. acnes, M. tuberculosis H37Rv (MIC 0.005-0.25 ug/ml) (anti-TB), H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis (MIC 2-4 ug/ml), and moderately E. coli MIC (25 ug/ml).

And the classic paper in the ref is recommended by Dr. Gallo as the beginning (birth) of modern innate immunity. The structure and activity relationship of human lysozyme can be found in modern Biochemistry textbooks. It catalytically hydrolyzes bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan and has also been
shown to exert catalysis-independent antimicrobial properties, thereby active against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. You can rotate, zoom, and view the crystal structure here in the PDB. It showed synergistic effect with LL-37 (Abou Aliwa et al., 2014).
